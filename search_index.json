Android Client User Guide\nThis is a guide for users to familiarize themselves with the OpenMRS Android client.\nThis guide is both: a starting point for new developers who want to contribute to the Android Client; and as a reference to problems which developers may face. It contains detailed descriptions of all the features along with how one can use them.\nThis guide will have FAQs, Troubleshooting, Glossary and Contact sections which will be helpful for any user facing problems.\nWhat is OpenMRS?\nOpenMRS is a patient-based medical record system focused on giving providers a free, customizable Electronic Medical Record system (EMR).\nThe mission of OpenMRS is to improve health care delivery in resource-constrained environments by coordinating a global community that creates a robust, scalable, user-driven, open source medical record system platform.\nMore details can be found in official page and github repository.\nMotivation for OpenMRS Android Client\nIn hospitals and clinics there arenâ€™t many computers and most of the work is done manually. It involves a tiresome work to maintain patient records manually.\nMarket share of Android phones is around 82%. Due to cheap prices and popularity of Android phones, Android apps can be used to do the work easily and efficiently. We can also use some features provided by phones - such as camera, GPS and voice recording - to make the app even more useful. This is also an especially suitable solution for developing countries.\nAn Android app which functions smoothly, and makes hospital/clinical staffs' work more effective and efficient, is needed. Instead of using a large-sized computer which allows little flexibility, the clinical staff may use Android phones/tablets.\nUseful Links\n\nRelated discussion can be found here.\nIf you want to contribute, issue link is here.\nThe guide is hosted here and deployed by Travis (see the build status at the top).\n\n"},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Getting started","keywords":"","body":"Getting started\nInstallation\nTo install the OpenMRS Android Client on your Android device, head over to Google Play using this link:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openmrs.mobile\nRequirements:\n\nAndroid device with Android OS 4.1 or higher\nOpenMRS server 2.2 or higher with REST module installed\n\nLogging in\nAs you start the OpenMRS application, you are presented with the login screen.\nHere, you may provide the address to an OpenMRS server as well as login credentials. If you don't have access to your own server, or just wish to test out the application, you can use the following information:\n\nServer URL: https://demo.openmrs.org/openmrs\nUsername: admin\nPassword: Admin123\n\n\nNB: To be able to login you must provide a location (e.g. \"Inpatient Ward\") for the session in the dropdown list.\nUse Case - Patient Registration\nAfter having successfully logged in, you may perform different activities. For instance, if you wish to register a new patient, click the \"Register Patient\" icon. You will be presented with a form in which you fill in the patient's information. When you have entered all the required information, press the \"Register Patient\" button at the end of the form. If the registration was successful, you will be presented with the patient's summary view from which you can access his/her visits and vitals information etc.\n\n\n"},"patient-registration.html":{"url":"patient-registration.html","title":"Patient Registration","keywords":"","body":"Registering a New Patient\nYou can register new patients by clicking on the Register Patient button in the home menu. When online, created patients are automatically synchronized to the server wih a unique patient ID. When offline, created patients are saved in the user's local database and are synced when the user is connected to the internet. See Working Offline for more details.\n1. Entering Patient Details\n\nAfter clicking Register Patient, you will be presented with a form to fill out the patient's basic information. You should input the patient's name, gender and birth date. You'll also need to fill at least one field of the patient's contact information. When done, press \"Register Patient\" button at the bottom.\nIf you did not enter the required details, you will be shown a message showing which fields are needed to be filled in order to complete registration.\n\nAfter successfully adding a new patient, a summary regarding patient's data along with the patient photo is shown. From here you can start to interact with the patient, such as visiting the patient and entering biometrics data in the patient's vitals. These events are easily accessed by either swiping right/left or clicking on the event's tab. Take a look at Viewing Patients for more things to do with a patient.\nYou can also update or delete the patient by heading to the menu and clicking Update Patient or Delete Patient.\n2. Adding Patient Photo\n\nA cool feature in the Android client during registration is the ability to upload a photo related to the patient. To do this, click on the camera icon. You can either take a photo now or choose an existing photo in your phone/tablet. The photo will then be cropped to match the requried dimensions.\n3. Finding Similar Patients\n\nWhen registering a new patient offline, similar existing patients will be shown to help you merge the patients. Similar patients are defined by patients having the same names, gender, address and date of birth. You can choose either to merge to an existing patient, or register the patient as new. Either way, the patient data will be synced when connected to the internet.\nUpdating a Patient\n\nTo update a patient's data, simply click on the patient in the Find Patients menu, then click the menu icon (three-dot icon) and select Update Patient. Now you can update any fields such as his/her name, address, phone number, etc.\nWhen you are done, simply press the Submit button at the bottom, and your patient will be updated. You can also cancel the updating process by clicking the arrow button in the Action bar.\nViewing Patients\nPatients that you have created from the client or synced patients from the server are shown in the Find Patients section. From here you can select a patient to do numerous events, such as visiting the patient, capturing vitals and so forth. See the patient activity page for more details.\nDownloading Patients\n\nIf this is your first time using the Android client, you are likely to see an empty list of patients in Find Patients and you'll want to download and synchronize patients from your server. To do this, click the + button from the action bar, then click the search button and enter a patient name. You'll be shown a list of (unsynchronized) patients matching the searched name.\n\nTo download patients, simply click Download for patients you want to synchronize to your Android client. You can also long-press a patient to enter Download Mode, enabling you to download a selection of patients conveniently. Afterwards, downloaded (and synchronized) patients are seen at the Synced Patients screen.\nFinding Existing Patients\n\nTo find locally synchronized patients, press on the menu icon (3-dot icon) and click Find Patients. Now enter a name query and it will return patients matching the inputted query.\n"},"patient-activity.html":{"url":"patient-activity.html","title":"Patient Activity","keywords":"","body":"Patient Activity\nDiagnosis\nWhen viewing a patient, you are able to see illnesses or diseases a patient suffers from. Simply head over to the Diagnosis tab to see the patient's list of illnesses or diseases.\nVisits\nA Visit is a time period when a patient is actively interacting with the healthcare system, typically at a location. In most cases with OpenMRS, this is a time when a provider is interacting actively with a patient. Visits are where encounters take place; which are used to record a patient's vitals, diagnose a patient and a few other things.\n\nTo start a visit to a patient, simply go to the Visits tab and click the 'start' button in the action bar. You can see which patients are currently visited by heading to Active Visits from home. Now you can choose to end the visit by clicking on the visit, clicking the menu icon and clicking End Visit.\nVitals\n\nDuring a visit, you are able to record a patient's vitals (commonly known as biometric data). To capture a vital, simply go to the Vitals tab and click on the 'note' icon. From here, you can start to input the patient's biometric data. When done, press the Submit button at the bottom. You can also cancel capturing a vital by using your back button or the 'up' icon in the action bar. After submitting a vital, you will see an updated patient vitals form at the vitals tab.\nEncounters\nEncounters usually take place during a visit, however they may also stand alone. Think of an encounter as any collection of data inputted to the EMR system. Generally speaking, every time you enter a form in OpenMRS this creates an Encounter.\nIn the Android client, there is a collection of encounters readily made to input data to patients during their visits. This is done in the Form Entry section. To see the process of creating a form (an encounter) in the client, go to the Form Entry section from home, then select a patient (preferably a patient on a visit).\n\nLet's create a Visit Note form to note down experiences regarding the patient's visit. Answer the questions regarding the patient and click 'Submit' (You will see this form in the patient's visit page later on).\nCharts\nFinally, you may see a graph for patients, measuring height, weight and other observations corresponding to recorded patient vitals in the Charts tab.\n\n\nNow, when heading to Active Visits and selecting the example patient, you will hopefully see that a Vitals form and a Visit Note form are successfully recorded during the patient's visit.\n\nTo learn more about the OpenMRS information model, take a look at this guide for developers.\n\n"},"provider-management.html":{"url":"provider-management.html","title":"Create Provider","keywords":"","body":"Provider Management\nThis module lets you manage Providers by providing actions such as Creating, Deleting or Editing Providers. You can also see all the other Providers, their roles and their relationships with other Providers or Patients.\n\nCreate Provider\n\nOn opening the Provider Management, you are greeted with a screen with active providers and a Floating Action Button. Click on the Floating Action Button and it will take you to new screen asking for Provider details. \n\nThe details are then matched with other existing Providers and a dialog box is shown for confirmation.\nUpdate Providers\nTo update a Provider, swipe left on the Provider to reveal additional actions (Update and Delete). Click on the edit button. It will take you to a screen where the details can be edited.\nDelete Providers\n\nTo delete a Provider, swipe left on the Provider to reveal additional actions(Update and Delete). Click on the delete button and a confirmation to delete the Provider will be shown.\nProvider Relationship Dashboard\n\nClick on a particular Provider, to go to a new screen with the Provider's details. It has 2 tabs - Provider-Patient relationships and Provider-Provider relationships. Currently these screens are empty. \nProvider Relationship will be added to this screen in the future.\n\nTo learn more about the OpenMRS information model, take a look at this guide for developers.\n\n"},"feeding-data.html":{"url":"feeding-data.html","title":"Feeding Data","keywords":"","body":"Data Input\nOpenMRS's Android app supports a number of types to input data, such as a patient's information or details of the hospital. Providers are able to input data into the OpenMRS system generally by using forms. \nCurrently, there are 3 pre-made forms to record information regarding a patient. They are Admission forms, Visit Notes and Vital forms.\n1. Admission\nThis form is used when a patient is needed to live in the hospital while under treatment.\nCurrently, this form is not implemented yet in the mobile client, so inpatients will have to be admitted in the main OpenMRS web application.\n\nAn admission form in the main web app.\n2. Visit Note\nThis form is to capture any information during a patient's visit.\n\nThere are short checkpoint sections in this form, as well as a writing space to record other important details that other sections are missing. After completing the form, simply click 'Submit'.\n3. Vitals\nProviders are also able to capture a patient's biometric information, which may be done through a 'vitals form'.\n\nWhen recording biometric information, providers are required to record the patient's blood pressure, pulse, breath rate, body temperature, weight and height. Click 'Submit' to save the captured data to the system.\nAdding New Forms to the App\nThere is still a short limit regarding the types of data that can be stored when using the Android client. However, it is possible to input other types of data into the system by creating new forms on the server, which can be done via the OpenMRS web app.\nTo do this, access your OpenMRS instance from the web application and log in. Next, select System Administration -> Advanced Administration -> Forms -> Manage Forms.\n\n\n\n\nCreating new forms from the OpenMRS web app.\nYou may add a new form by clicking the 'Add Form' hyperlink and filling up the name of the form, description and other required fields. Once finished, click Save Form and you should see the newly created form both on the Forms page and finally in the Form Entry section in the Android client.\n"},"working-offline.html":{"url":"working-offline.html","title":"Working Offline","keywords":"","body":"Working Offline\n\nThe OpenMRS Android Client can also be successfully used in areas with limited connectivity. As you open the OpenMRS Android Client the login screen appears. Here you may provide your login credentials and a location (e.g. \"Registration Desk\")\nTo use the client in the offline mode you may press the option just beside the word \"online\" to switch to the offline mode. \nUsing Offline Mode requires a previous sign-in with the credentials provided, and thus is disabled on initial login attempts\n\nRegistering Patients\n   \n   After successfully logging in you will be presented with a dashboard from where you can register or view patients.\n   \n   From there you can select the Register Patient option which will take you to a form in which you can fill the patient details.\n   \n   After entering all the details press the \"Register Patient\" button at the bottom. After successful registration of the patient you will be taken to a page which shows the summary view of the patient. While working offline the patient's ID will be NULL. Whenever the client will get connected to the internet it will assign an ID to the patient.\n   \n   If a similar patient is found on the server, the client will prompt you with an option to either \"merge\" the patients or \"register as new\".\n   \nSynchronizing Patients\n   \n   Whenever there is connectivity you can sync the patient data with the server. The synced patients can be seen from the Find Patients section. The data is synced automatically whenever you're connected to the internet.\n    \nCurrently, patient activity under offline mode is limited to inputting encounters.\n"},"settings.html":{"url":"settings.html","title":"Settings","keywords":"","body":"Settings\nThe settings of the OpenMRS Android Client shows the path to access the log file. A log file records the events occurring in a software or an operating system. Logging is the process of keeping a log. All the messages are written to a single log file. Logging helps to understand what exactly a code is doing. It provides data about a code. This feature helps to fix errors and improve app operation. It helps greatly in debugging the software.\n\n"},"security.html":{"url":"security.html","title":"Security","keywords":"","body":"Security Features\nOpenMRS ensures the security of data stored through various encryption algorithms. The whole system uses several security features which protect the data both on the client's device and on the server where patient data is stored.\nClient side\nOpenMRS Android Client has a very handy feature, which is Offline Mode - it allows the user to access and modify patient data without internet connection (and synchronize it with the server database later). It's useful in places where connectivity is limited. This functionality, of course, wouldn't be possible without storing a copy of patient data on the user's smartphone.\nTo ensure that sensitive, personal data of the patients are safe, even if the user's device is stolen or breached, OpenMRS Android Client provides these security measures to protect the data:\n1. Hashing user's password\nBoth in online and offline mode the user has to enter their login credentials to access the system. Password verification is simple - the system compares the password from the database and user's input. The problem is that the password shouldn't be stored in the plaintext form, because it would be possible to copy it directly from device's memory - instead of storing the password itself, an irreversible digest is saved. To see if the user has entered correct password, the same function is used on the user's password input and the digests are compared.\nFor this purpose, the OpenMRS Android app uses BCrypt hashing function (you can read more about password hashing here). BCrypt is currently one of the safest password hashing functions available and it is future-proof (it's easy to increase its complexity in the future to prevent from brute-force attacks).\n2. Local database encryption\nManaging information about patients (personal data, medical record) is a huge responsibility. To protect the copy of the data on the phone, the database is encrypted using AES-256 cipher, which uses a combination of user's username and password as its key. This encryption function makes it impossible to decrypt the data without entering valid username and password, so even if the device is stolen or breached - it's not possible to decrypt the database without login credentials.\nServer side\n1. Patient Identifiers are Validated\nSpecifically, OpenMRS uses a variation of Luhn algorithm also known as the 'mod10' algorithm. Simply put, this algorithm has the capacity to validate a variety of identification numbers. In fact, this is commonly used to validate credit card numbers. For more information, please check out the following link regarding the Luhn algorithm to gain a better understanding on how it works.\nOpenMRS utilizes a variation of the Luhn algorithm which the Regenstrief Institue has created. In this variation, letters as well as numbers in the identifier (i.e., alphanumeric identifiers) are allowed.\nThis is especially useful when creating new Patient Identifiers. Manually inputting Patient Identifiers is very prone to errors, which is why a check digit algorithm is necessary. For more information, please check out the following link\n2. Data is Transmitted Through a Secure SSL Conncection\nThe Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) ensures an encrypted link between the server and a browser. This ensures that the data remains private and legal. OpenMRS is verified to activate SSL on their web server. This secures the data that is being transmitted from the Android device to the web server. For more information on how SSL connection works, please visit the following link.\n3. Strings are Hashed\nStrings of data in an OpenMRS instance are encrypted at minimum using SHA-512, which is the preferred encryption method to be used by OpenMRS. SHA-512 is designed to be a one-way function. Simply put, it is very hard to decrypt an input with a brute-force search (simply trying all possible inputs). To add to this, it would take quadzillions of years to decrypt a single password. Check out the following link for more information.\nWith these security features, and more to be implemented, OpenMRS ensures that the chances of data breaches is very low, ensuring the privacy and security of patients and health centers using OpenMRS.\n"},"glossary.html":{"url":"glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nadministrative staff: Individuals who manage people or data in a clinical setting.\nandroid client: The OpenMRS mobile client for accessing OpenMRS server instance on Android devices.\nchart: A graph for patients, measuring height, weight and other observations corresponding to recorded patient vitals.\nclinician: A doctor, nurse, or other clinical officer who provides health care to patients.\nconcept: The idea that encompasses any question which can be asked about a patient; an observable point of data.\ndata: A piece of knowledge that can be reduced to a single value.\nelectronic medical record (EMR): A computer system that allows for recording, storage, and retrieval of information related to the delivery of health care to patients.\nencounter: A clinical transaction between a patient and one or more healthcare providers for the purpose of providing patient services or assessing the health status of the patient.
